    "Indeed, this was the solution that Copilot gave me, and I ran with it for a while until I later thought, \"hmm, this isn't good enough. I can definitely do better.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to implement the function using NumPy-only functions, and it turned out like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def values_at_frac_max(xs, ys, fraction: float = 0.135):\n",
    "    # The naive way using NumPy:\n",
    "    max_height = np.max(ys)\n",

    "Now, this is much better: compact and expressive. However, this is incompatible with JAX's `vmap`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, why do I want `vmap`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it's because I wrote my functions to be able to operate on a single curve, but I will eventually need to do this for a rolling window of pairs of curves. This means needing to `vmap` over each pair of curves and then `lax.scan` over each pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is the function above incompatible with `vmap`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The culprit here is that **`np.where` returns a vector with a variable size, not fixed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the JAX devs knew about this problem and put in a `size` argument. This allowed me to re-express the solution as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def values_at_frac_max(xs, ys, fraction: float = 0.135):\n",
    "    # The fancy way using JAX's `size` argument:\n",
    "    max_height = np.max(ys)\n",
    "    idxs_min = np.where(ys >= max_height * fraction, size=1)[0]\n",
    "    idxs_max = np.where(ys >= max_height * fraction, size=len(xs))[0]\n",
    "    return np.array([xs[idxs_min.min()], xs[idxs_max.max()]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key tricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We use `idxs_min` to grab out the first point at which the y-values are greater than or equal to the desired height. This is why we grab out just one element.\n",
    "2. We use `idxs_max` to do the same, except we use `len(xs)` as the size to return, as it is _guaranteed_ to give us the upper-bound index.\n",
    "3. Finally, we create a new NumPy array with the exact values we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `vmap` on the new `values_at_frac_max` function gives us the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vmap(values_at_frac_max)(xs, ys)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Array([[ 60.012005,  99.98    ],\n",
    "       [ 79.996   , 159.992   ]], dtype=float32)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting the points shows us that we got the right thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y1, color=\"red\")\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y2, color=\"blue\")\n",
