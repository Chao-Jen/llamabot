GitHub is a social coding site, where users can collaborate on code in repositories. In this network, nodes are users, and edges indicate that two users are collaborators on at least one GitHub repository. What you'll be accomplishing by the end of the exercises is the following:You will have analyzed the structure of the graph, including basic properties. You will visualize the graph using nxviz, and Finally, you will build a simple recommendation system. A recommendation system in social networks recommends users to \"connect\" with one another in some fashion. In the GitHub context, we will try writing a recommender that suggests users that should collaborate together. Before I launch you into the exercises,\n",
